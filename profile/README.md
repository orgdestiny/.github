## üìö Welcome 
<img src="https://github.com/orgdestiny/.github/blob/main/images/destiny.png?raw=true">
We are a private association, formed by the pillars of cooperation, projects, education and fellowship. We are here to express and form our opinions and explore human knowledge; we will try to understand and teach you in the best way! Knowledge is not a gift, we agree that we all have the right to obtain a higher intellectual capacity than we expect; and our organization guarantees this. Currently, we have several areas that may be enjoyed by our students. 

### ‚ùì Our principles

We devote special attention to the ethical and moral formation of the members, we aim to enhance the learner as a human person, having the development of intellectual autonomy and critical thinking through dialogue and respect for cultural diversity; development of the ability to learn, having as basic means the full mastery of logical reasoning; understanding of the work and systematic environment and basic preparation for work; development of the learner's citizenship, to continue learning, so as to be able to adapt with flexibility to new socio-educational conditions and the understanding of the scientific-technological foundations of the productive processes.

### üì° Connections
Our goal is to integrate all of our future projects into the platform, from our Development team and future contributors. Destiny expands its connections everywhere, and here, we will be encouraging creativity, creation. The beginning of a new story! A new project. Where it will be open for any kind of doubts, suggestions and participation. With the main goal of bringing knowledge and new adventures; and with that, experience. Destiny becomes a Hub, with a control... We are a *GitHub*!
