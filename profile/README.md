#### We are a private association, formed by the pillars of cooperation, projects, education and fellowship. We are here to express and form our opinions and explore human knowledge; we will try to understand and teach you in the best way! Knowledge is not a gift, we agree that we all have the right to obtain a higher intellectual capacity than we expect; and our organization guarantees this. Currently, we have several areas that may be enjoyed by our students.
